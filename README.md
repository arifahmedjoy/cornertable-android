## Instruction
I have given access to the documents.

The very first thing we need to do is update my existing android app for my social media site.

Please create an account on my social media site:

https://cornertable.us/

I will give admin powers. Do this first.

The android app is currently here:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cornertable.app

Please download and install and login with the user/admin account so you can see how it works right now.

There is an update to this app which I do not have the ability to do, which is why you are doing it. In the google drive, I have uploaded the app files, as well as the source files for my cornertable site.

I have also uploaded a file which has all the API keys I'm aware of. (There are also license keys in the source files .zips, and some in the admin section of my site.)

Everything you need to compile the new updated app should be in the google drive or found in the admin part of my site. To UPLOAD, I will need to give you access to the google account associated with my social media site. Please let me know when you are ready for that information.

This is the first task. Please keep me updated on its progress.
